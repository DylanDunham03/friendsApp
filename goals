Here are the goals we are tying to achieve.
1. Building the AI/ML algorithm for being able to suggest new locations, places. 
2. Finding an API that can create the image for each thing the AI/ML algorithm suggests.
3. Adding a username and password system to be used by users; authentication; connection to friends; being able to make a pool.
    (Pool -> A group created which is where the recommendations are being recommended based on earlier created keywords - groups shoudl work similar to splitwise)
4. Make sure that users are being assigned to correct room based on codes, invites, links (focus on one or the other first.)
5. While working on this make sure you are actively concerned about the integration section; ideally build the front end and back end together.
